# Configuration

This directory contains ROS 2 parameter files used by the controller and path recorder nodes. The launch files in `../launch/` load these files by default; pass the `params_file` launch argument to use a different YAML file.

## Files

- `pure_pursuit_params.yaml` configures the `pure_pursuit_controller` node, including its path and topic names, vehicle wheelbase, look-ahead behavior, speed settings, goal tolerance, and control rate.
- `path_recorder_params.yaml` configures path recording and writes the reference waypoints to `~/waypoints.csv` by default.
- `actual_trajectory_recorder_params.yaml` configures trajectory recording and writes the executed trajectory to `~/actual_trajectory.csv` by default.

The sample files currently use `/home/nombre_usuario/...` for their CSV paths. Update `path_file` or `output_file` when running under a different account or storing data elsewhere. Recorder output includes position, yaw, and linear and angular velocity.
